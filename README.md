#Q-ing

##The Description
The concept of Q-ing was the idea of my teammate Vanessa Biggers. She wanted a way to see how long the wait was at different bathrooms at concert events. From that idea evolved Q-ing.

Q-ing is a way for people to time their wait for things like: getting a table at a restaurant, or the wait for the bathroom at a music festival. Their wait time is added to a database. The app calculates the average wait time of all users for a location within the past two hours. Their wait time is averaged with the others and the new average is shared with other Q-ing users when they view that location in the Q-ing app. It allows people to decide if they want to go to a place based on how long the wait is.

##The Senario
Vanessa's idea was picked as a final project option, myself, Lawrence Ma, and Yen Tran were added to the team, and we built Q-ing over the course of one week using agile development methodologies. Our main goal was not just to build a great project, but to learn as much as possible from the process.

##The Code
The app is built on the Ruby on Rails framework. It utilizes the Google Maps, and Yelp APIs, and Twitter's Bootstrap CSS framework. It is rather javascript heavy. Hosted on a Heroku server.
